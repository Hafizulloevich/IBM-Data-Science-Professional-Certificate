ðŸš€ Project Summary: Predicting SpaceX Rocket Landings
This project uses data science to predict if the first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. Because successful landings make space launches much cheaper, this prediction helps determine the cost of a launch.

## Key Questions
The project aimed to answer a few main questions:

What factors matter most? How do things like the rocket's cargo weight (payload mass), launch location, and flight history affect a successful landing?

Are they getting better? Has SpaceX's success rate for landing the first stage improved over the years?

What's the best tool for the job? Which predictive algorithm works best for guessing the landing outcome (a simple "yes" or "no")?

## Project Steps
Get the Data: Information was collected from two sources: SpaceX's API, Wikipedia web-scraping

Clean the Data: The data was cleaned up by fixing errors, dealing with missing information, and converting non-numerical data into numeric.

Explore the Data: The data was analyzed using charts, graphs, and database queries (SQL) to find interesting patterns and trends.

Create Visuals: Interactive maps (Folium) and dashboards (Plotly Dash) were built to help visualize the launch data and make it easier to understand.

Build Predictive Models: Several machine learning models were created and tested to find the most accurate one for predicting, and Decision Tree Classifier was the most accurate in our cse.
